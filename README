# cc-scraper v?
The [cc-scraper](https://github.com/JinwookKim/cc-scraper) library is used as an npm module or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module.


## installation
Using npm:
```javascript
npm i -s cc-scraper

In Node.js:

const cards = require('cc-scraper');

cards.getChaseCashBackCal((error, result) => {
    console.log('result = ', result);

```

Output (something similar to):
```javascript

```
Quarter 1: January - March
Quarter 2: April - June
Quarter 3: July - September
Quarter 4: October - December

There will be occasions where some quarters are missing. For example, in the output above is missing `quarter 4`. That is because on their website calendar, they haven't finalized quarter 4 categories that will attribute to the 5% cash back (at the time of this writing). Therefore, my code will neglect that quarter.

See the [source code](https://github.com/JinwookKim/cc-scraper) for more details.
